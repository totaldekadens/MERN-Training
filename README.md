# MERN Training - Soccer Management

This project is based on LinkedinLearning: MERN Essential Training (2020) by Emmanuel Henri.

Languages/Frameworks/Libraries the project touches:

* Mongoose
* Express
* React.js
* Node.js
* Materialize

The project he did during the training left me with some development opportunities (mainly client side). So that is what I will continue with here.

To do:

* Convert all class-components to functional components. ✅
* Change axios to fetch. ✅
* Add validation to form (simple) ✅
* Complete the form so it matches the player model (Schema) incl. validation.
* Make it possible to delete player (client)
* Make it possible to update player (client)
* Styling (incl responsivity). Change from Materialize to MUI?
